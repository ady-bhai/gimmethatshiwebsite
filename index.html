        <h1>Aditya Mehta</h1>
        <p>I'm Aditya, an undergraduate at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>, studying Math, Finance, and Cognition. Broadly, I have an interest in data and data infrastructure, particularly in the context of machine learning.</p>
        <p>I am currently working with Dr. Raul Castro Fernandez in the ChiData research group at UChicago on the Veg project, focused on finding views in an interactive, general way by profiling data efficiently.</p>
        <p>I am the Development Director for WHPK, the University of Chicago's community radio station. I am also a DJ, web developer, board member, and the international music format chief. You can hear me play a variety of music from around the world on Tuesdays from 1-2 CST. I especially like to play electronic, but you'll hear a little bit of everything on my show.</p>
